# AI_SnakeGame_DeepQLearning

Training an agent to play the classic Snake game using reinforcement learning (Deep Q-Learning Algorithm).

The grid density in the Snake game and the number of parallel environments during training can be adjusted through the `DENSITY` and `NUMBEROFGAMES` variables in the `snakeai.py` file.

To run the agent, open a terminal in the root directory and execute:
`python snake.py`
